vscode-settings

I use the nifty extension "CodeSync" to sync my VisualStudio Code settings between multiple
environments.  Unfortunately, it seems that that extension at times has caused my settings files
to get set to null.  SO, I put them in git version control, so I didn't have to load up Dropbox's
website every few days and hit "Restore", i could do it right from whatever computer had a
screwed up copy of the settings.

So, since I had it in a git repo, I figured I'd share it.

Enjoy.
